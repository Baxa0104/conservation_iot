# Conservation IoT Climate Controller

This project is a smart, offline-first IoT climate control system designed for conservation environments. It uses sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, and gas levels, and controls outputs like fans and alarms.

## 📌 Goals

- Offline operation in remote zones
- Modular design for small enclosures (plants, animals, labs)
- Low power consumption
- Optional AI-based summaries
- Web dashboard (stretch goal)

## 📁 Structure

- `/docs`: Planning docs, user stories, flowcharts
- `/hardware`: Circuit diagrams, pinout, components
- `/firmware`: Main microcontroller code
- `/test`: Test sketches (sensor readouts, relay tests)
- `/web`: Future dashboard code (HTML/JS)
- `/assets`: Screenshots, images

## 👷‍♂️ Status: Planning Phase (July 2025)
